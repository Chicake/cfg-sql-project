# CFG: Data & SQL project
## CFG Data & SQL course
I have done [this course](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/classes/uni-kickstarter/) during the summer 2022. It is a 8 weeks course with 2 hours class per week (and homework), which covered the following topics:
- Database management
- Database creation
- Data manipulatioin
- Data visualisation
- Data analysis (e.g., groupby, joins)
- Subqueries
- Views
- Stored functions and procedures
- Events/triggers
- Backups

## My project: KaedeAnimeList
This repository contains all the work I have done for the final project of the course. It is a SQL database, inspired by MyAnimeList, which stores all the information about anime and users, which allows back-end stuff (e.g., sign in) and analyse the data to see the current trend in the anime world. The [KaedeAnimeList.sql](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-sql-project/blob/main/KaedeAnimeList.sql) contains my SQL code for the project (do not worry, all the data is made-up and fake!) and [Kaede presentation.pdf](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-sql-project/blob/main/Kaede%20presentation.pdf) is the slides used during my project presentation. I used the slide template from [slidecarnival](https://www.slidescarnival.com/jachimo-free-presentation-template/1393), which the hyperlink will take you to the downloading page. Below picture is my DB diagram to show the relation between the tables.
